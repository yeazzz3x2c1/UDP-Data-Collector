# UDP-Data-Collector
This project contains two parts: a server and a client. This system allows multiple clients to upload files to the server simultaneously using the UDP protocol, while ensuring the files' integrity. The server is developed using C#, and the client is developed using Python.

We provide a simple example in the "Data Collector API" folder; check the file "client_codes_example.py" for more details. This system could make it very easy for you to transmit files from the client to the server.
